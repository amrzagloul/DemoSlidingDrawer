= Introduction =
We finally found an easier way to translate Android application strings and have set this up for SMS Popup.  We have miracle2k's [http://github.com/miracle2k/android2po android2po] to thank!

This page contains a short howto and FAQs for using this new translation mechanism.  Please let us know if you have any questions or comments.

= Howto: Contributing translated strings to SMS Popup =
 # Register on [https://launchpad.net/ Launchpad].
 # Go to [https://translations.launchpad.net/smspopup smspopup translations]
 # Choose you language and start translating!

= FAQs =

== I want to translate it to language X but it's not listed on Launchpad ==
Go to your user preference and add language X.
_language preference is at https://launchpad.net/~youruser/+editlanguages_

After adding it, it will appear on the list.

== When will the new translations show in SMS Popup? ==
We don't have a strict release schedule right now, however in the past there has been one new public SMS Popup release every 4-6 weeks.  Each time we do a release to Android Market we will sync the translated strings from Launchpad to SVN.

== I found an incorrect translation, should I fix it? ==
Of course! You can re-translate any of the current strings if you spot an error.
